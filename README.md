## Introduction

### Overview
The "Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python" project focuses on exploring the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) market, a key area of interest due to increasing environmental concerns, regulatory pressures, and consumer demand for sustainable transportation. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the market's current state, trends in EV adoption, geographical distribution, and the popularity of different EV models. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the project seeks to uncover the drivers of growth in the EV market and assess its future potential, offering strategic insights for stakeholders.


### Objectives
The objectives of the analysis include tracking the growth of electric vehicle (EV) registrations over time to understand how the market is expanding. It involves identifying regional patterns to pinpoint areas with the highest density of EV registrations. The analysis will segment the data by different types of electric vehicles, such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to provide insights into the distribution of vehicle categories. Additionally, it aims to determine the most popular brands and models within the EV market. Evaluating the electric range trends will help in understanding technological advancements while estimating the future growth of the EV market will offer insights into its potential trajectory.



## Business Problem / Stakeholder Concerns
The aim is to analyze the market size of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State (WA). The insights will help stakeholders understand the distribution, trends, and demographics of EV ownership, and identify key factors influencing the adoption of EVs. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, automotive companies, and utility providers to support and enhance the growth of the EV market.

## Importing Libraries
To begin the analysis, we first need to import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.


```python
  from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
```

## Data Loading

First, we load the dataset containing information on electric vehicles:

```python
# Importing the necessary library
import pandas as pd

# Loading the dataset
ev_data = pd.read_csv("Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv")

# Displaying the column names
ev_data.columns
```
