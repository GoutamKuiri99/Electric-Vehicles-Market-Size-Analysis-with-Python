This table provides a clear view of the number of missing values for each column in the dataset.

 **2. Handling Missing Values**

 **Strategy: Impute with Mode or Common Value**

For categorical columns with missing values, we fill in the missing values using the mode (most frequent value) for each column. This approach ensures that the imputation is based on the most common category, which helps maintain data consistency.

**Example: Imputing Missing Values in 'County' Column**

First, we identify the mode for the 'County' column:

```python
# Calculate mode for the 'County' column
mode_county = ev_data["County"].mode()[0]
```


## Outlier Detection to All Numerical Columns and Handling

Outliers in numerical columns can significantly skew the results of any analysis, so it's essential to detect and handle them appropriately. We use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and count outliers in the numerical columns of our dataset.

### Methodology: IQR Method for Outlier Detection

The IQR method calculates the range between the 1st quartile (Q1) and the 3rd quartile (Q3) of the data. Outliers are defined as data points that fall below `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR`.

### Python Code for Outlier Detection

Below is the Python code used to detect and count outliers in numerical columns using the IQR method:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Function to handle outliers using the IQR method and return the count of outliers
def count_outliers_iqr(df, column):
    data = df[column]
    Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1

    # Define outlier bounds
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

    # Identify outliers
    outliers = df[(data < lower_bound) | (data > upper_bound)]
    
    return len(outliers)

# List of numerical columns to process
numerical_columns = ['Model Year', 'Electric Range', 'Base MSRP', 'Legislative District', 'DOL Vehicle ID', '2020 Census Tract']

# Initialize a dictionary to store the count of outliers for each column
outliers_count = {}

# Count outliers for each numerical column
for col in numerical_columns:
    outliers_count[col] = count_outliers_iqr(ev_data, col)

# Print outliers count for each column
print("Outliers count for each column:")
for col, count in outliers_count.items():
    print(f"{col}: {count}")

# Calculate the total number of outliers across all columns
total_outliers = sum(outliers_count.values())
print(f"\nTotal number of outliers across all columns: {total_outliers}")
```

### Outliers Count

The table below shows the count of outliers for each numerical column:

| Column Name               | Outliers Count |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Model Year                | 876            |
| Electric Range            | 0              |
| Base MSRP                 | 3425           |
| Legislative District      | 0              |
| DOL Vehicle ID            | 14122          |
| 2020 Census Tract         | 343            |

### Total Outliers

The total number of outliers across all columns is **18,766**.

### Conclusion

Handling outliers is crucial to maintaining the quality and reliability of the data. By identifying and managing outliers, we ensure that the dataset is clean and the results of any subsequent analysis are accurate and meaningful.

### Checking or Ensuring Final Cleaned Dataset

After applying the appropriate strategies to handle missing values, it's important to verify that all missing values have been successfully addressed. We can check this by using the `.isnull().sum()` function, which returns the count of missing values in each column.

```python
# Verify missing values in the dataset
ev_data.isnull().sum()
```

After handling the missing values, the following table shows the count of missing values in each column:

| Column Name                                          | Missing Values |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| VIN (1-10)                                           | 0              |

%matplotlib inline

yearly_adoption=df_filtered['Model Year'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Visualize the trend
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
yearly_adoption.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='c', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, markersize=8)  # Customize color and style
plt.title('EV Adoption Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Model Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of EVs Registered')
plt.grid(True)

# Adding an additional color for markers
plt.scatter(yearly_adoption.index,yearly_adoption,color='m',s=100,zorder=5)
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/025dcaeb-5026-4c68-aea8-0f3e05214ad2)
The line chart illustrates a clear upward trend in EV registrations, especially from 2011 onwards. Early registrations were very low, with just 1 in 1997 and 9 in 2000. Starting in 2011, there was a significant increase, with numbers rising to 807. The growth became more pronounced from 2016, reaching 5.3K and peaking at 13.7K in 2018. The highest point was in 2022 with 27.9K registrations. In 2023, there was a slight decline to 22.5K, though the overall trend remains positive. The 2024 figure of 30 suggests preliminary or incomplete data. Overall, the chart demonstrates a strong growth trajectory in EV adoption over the years.

### Market Size Growth
#### Estimated Market Size Analysis of Electric Vehicles in the United States
Now, letâ€™s move forward towards finding the estimated market size of electric vehicles in the United States. Iâ€™ll first count the number of EVs registered every year:

```
# calculate the number of EVs registered each year
ev_registration_counts = ev_data['Model Year'].value_counts().sort_index()
ev_registration_counts
```
Weâ€™ll calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between a recent year with complete data (2023) and an earlier year to project the 2024 figures. Additionally, using this growth rate, we can estimate the market size for the next five years. Letâ€™s proceed with these calculations:

```

filtered_years = ev_registration_counts[ev_registration_counts.index <= 2023]

# Define a function for exponential growth to fit the data
def exp_growth(x, a, b):
    return a * np.exp(b * x)

# Prepare the data for curve fitting
x_data = filtered_years.index - filtered_years.index.min()  # Normalize years
y_data = filtered_years.values

# Fit the data to the exponential growth function
params, covariance = curve_fit(exp_growth, x_data, y_data)

# Use the fitted function to forecast the number of EVs for 2024 and the next five years
forecast_years = np.arange(2024, 2024 + 6) - filtered_years.index.min()  # Normalize forecast years
forecasted_values = exp_growth(forecast_years, *params)

# Create a dictionary to display the forecasted values for easier interpretation
forecasted_evs = dict(zip(forecast_years + filtered_years.index.min(), forecasted_values))

print(forecasted_evs)

```
Now, letâ€™s plot the estimated market size data:

```
# Combine current and forecasted data
all_years = np.concatenate([filtered_years.index, forecast_years + filtered_years.index.min()])
all_values = np.concatenate([filtered_years.values, forecasted_values])

# Create DataFrame for visualization
market_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': all_years,
    'Estimated EV Registrations': all_values
})

# Plot current and forecasted data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(filtered_years.index, filtered_years.values, 'o-', label='Current Data', color='blue')
plt.plot(forecast_years + filtered_years.index.min(), forecasted_values, 's--', label='Forecasted Data', color='red')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Estimated EV Registrations')
plt.title('Current & Estimated EV Market')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d9bfbb8-6b44-4667-bbdb-329827d82be9)

**From the above graph, we can see:**

- The number of actual EV registrations remained relatively low and stable until around 2010, after which there was a consistent and steep upward trend, suggesting a significant increase in EV adoption.
